There is a considerable body of work (*is there?*) on the problem of intelligent query answering, which aims to do more than simple look-up based on the query.  However, this work tends to focus on different problems than the one we are interested in.  (cite Han et al) describes various approaches to this issue, where intelligent query answering is used to provide more (relevant) detail  than the query originally asked for, to provide summaries of data, and to rewrite queries into sub-queries.  However, the issue of data matching is not considered; rather, the question is about how much relevant information can be returned, assuming the query is correctly formed.  Work looking into intelligent query answering tend to assume far more complex databases than we have considered, where deduction rules, concept hierarchies and knowledge discovery tools are available.  We have kept our attention focussed on simple databases because we believe these are most common in the emergency-response scenario we are focussing on; however, investigating the combination of our matching techniques with intelligent-query-answering techniques for situations where more complex databases were available would be very interesting and could result in a more sophisticated approach to query answering.  (Han et al) also raises interesting questions about how to appropriately interact with the user and how to ensure that sensitive data is released in an appropriate way to appropriate people, which are also very relevant to an in-the-field version of our work.}
