This directory gets pointed to as the "source" dataset, as it
simulates the idea that a query must be derived from a real dataset
somewhere, which uses real prefixes.
The directory contains a random asssortment of files intended to allow
the program to derive an initial set of rdf prefixes.  Each file needs to
have the same name as the predicate in the query file.
Most files are variations of SEPA files, with cut down contents. Some
are guessed from the query.
