A couple of test queries for trying out csv files.
Works with datasets/csvtargets/*csv and datasets/csvsource/*csv

e.g. The query 
'NativePopulation'(geocode(10), 'Inuit', 'Geographic Population','Total population').

matches a source file
datasets/csvsource/NativePopulation.csv
and works on a target file
datasets/csvtargets/AustraliaAboriginalPopulation.csv
(Actually these two files have identical content)
